# Testing and TDD - exercise 1 

The file `test.py` contains a unit test. 

1. Inspect the code and see if you understand what it does. 
2. Run the test using `pytest test.py` in the `exercise1` directory. (install pytest first?)
3. (optional) If you are used to an IDE (such as VS Code, PyCharm or similar) open the code and try to run the test from within the IDE.
