## Chunk 1: no pair programming yet

```
do_analysis()
```

 * Problem 2: when do you trust your program? If testing, when are you done testing?

 * Learning goal: practice TDD cycle 5 times, 3x easy, 2x medium

  * is_zero
  * is_odd/is_even
  * divide (include division by zero)
  * add (including overflow!)
  * can_divide_by_three
  * sum_digits
  * get_array_length
  * is_palindrome (string)
  * is_palindrome (number)
  * get_proper_divisors
  * is_prime
  * is_roman_str
  * to_roman_str
  * roman_str_to_number
  * is_perfect
  * [calc_n_ways_to_climb_stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

 * Evaluation: 
   * View random students' GH commit history
   * Let random students demonstrate the TDD cycle
   * Ask: why TDD?

 * Technical needs: 
    * [Lars] List of student names
    * [Lars] Zoom: `r number_of_students / 2` group rooms, everyone can screen share
    * [Students]: GitHub account

## Chunk 2: pair programming

 * Problem 1: when do you trust someone else's program? How do you talk?

 * Learning goal: practice TDD cycle 5 times with CI, 1x easy, 2x medium, 1x hard

 * Project: refactor own code

 * Evaluation: 
  * Students have a Red-Green-Blue GitHub commit history
  * Students have GHA enabled, code breaks sometimes

 * Technical needs: 
    * [Lars] List of student names
    * [Lars] Zoom: `r number_of_students / 2` group rooms, everyone can screen share
    * [Students]: GitHub account
