# TDD 2

## Chunk 2: pair programming

 * Problem 1: when do you trust someone else's program? How do you talk?

 * Learning goal: practice TDD cycle 5 times with CI, 1x easy, 2x medium, 1x hard

 * Project: refactor own code

 * Evaluation: 
  * Students have a Red-Green-Blue GitHub commit history
  * Students have GHA enabled, code breaks sometimes

 * Technical needs: 
    * [Lars] List of student names
    * [Lars] Zoom: `r number_of_students / 2` group rooms, everyone can screen share
    * [Students]: GitHub account
