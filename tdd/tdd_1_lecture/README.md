# TDD

On average, 80% of the time we spend debugging.
Test-driven development is a technique used by
professional software developers to reduce this time,
by writing tests before the actual code.
Although this initially feels 'inside-out', it results
in correct code quicker.

In this hands-on workshop, we'll write tests for simple functions
to practice this way of developing.

It is assumed you can read basic Python code and that you
have an Python environment (e.g. Visual Studio Code) installed.
