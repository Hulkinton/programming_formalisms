# Optimisation

[taught by Richel]

 * Problem: code is slow. How to make it fast?

 * Theory:
   * Profiling
   * Big O
   * Bottlenecks: CPU versus file IO versus web IO
   * Techniques: sorting, storing
   * Other language: only if able
   * Multiple threads: not yet
   * Myths: for loops are always evil, always use assembly/C/C++/Rust

 * Learning goals:
   * Being able to make a profile
   * Done one optimalization, measure if it is actually better

 * Evaluation:
   * Profile visible on GHA
   * Profiling comparison visible on GHA
