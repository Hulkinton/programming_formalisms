When gathering requirements for the program the first iteration is based on analysing the project breif for subjects and actions, i.e nouns and verbs that will describe the possible demands the users have on the system, after the first pass pay attention to adjective and adverbials that may change a need or requirement. After this make a Table of requirments, from this a system uscase design can begin. After the Uscases have been deterimined go through each use case and see how an object or action can solve this use case. Design a object/class diagram to reflect this possibly through a collaborations diagaram.
