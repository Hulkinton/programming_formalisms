# Setup

## Setup for Mac / Linux users


## Setup for Windows users

There are several different ways to run the course material on a Windows
computer. Neither is perhaps optimal, and the material itself has not been
adapted specifically for Windows. Nevertheless, in principle everything
*should* be possible to run. A few ways you could setup:

- Use the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10 (see below) _**Recommended for the
  course**_

- Run as Linux through a virtual machine (and see the Linux setup above)
- Use the Windows 10 PowerShell, install git and clone the course repository
  (see the Mac/Linux setup above)

### Running in the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10

This will give you access to a full command-line bash shell based on Linux on your
Windows 10 PC. For the difference between the Linux Bash Shell and the PowerShell on Windows
10, see *e.g.* [this article](
https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/On-Windows-PowerShell-vs-Bash-comparison-gets-interesting).

Install Bash on Windows 10, following the instructions at *e.g.* one of these
resources:

- [Installing the Windows Subsystem and the Linux Bash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- [Installing and using Linux Bash on Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)
- [Installing Linux Bash on Windows](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/)

Open a bash shell Linux terminal and clone the GitHub repository
containing all files you will need for completing the tutorials as follows.
First, `cd` into a directory on your computer (or create one) where it makes
sense to download the course directory.

!!! tip
    You can find the directory where the Linux distribution is storing all its files by
    typing `explorer.exe .`. This will launch the Windows File Explorer showing the
    current Linux directory.
