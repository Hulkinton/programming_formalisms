# Learning line

> See bottom for the functions to-be-developed for The Big Project

## Tuesday part 1: Paradigms, Introduction to formalised development

## Tuesday part 2: TDD

> Goal: students have done multiple TDD cycles

 * [x] Why is TDD important?
 * [x] What is TDD?
 * [x] What is the TDD cycle?
 * [x] How the git history of TDD cycle looks like
 * [ ] Why TDD gives better software architecture
 * [ ] Why helpful error messages are important
 * [ ] How TDD allows for more helpful error messages
 * [ ] Why tests are valuable: they are what you discuss with your boss
 * [ ] Different types of tests: unit tests, etc.
 * [ ] [Hamcrest notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamcrest)
 * [ ] Writing functions for tests
 * [ ] Testing frameworks (and why not in course)

Other activities:

 * Collect GitHub usernames
 * Big project: individual repo with design

> Evaluation: git history on students's repositories

## Wednesday part 1: social coding, pair programming as a tool for rapid development

## Wednesday part 2: TDD

> Goal: students have done multiple TDD cycles socially

 * [ ] Add CI to TDD development
 * [ ] Add build badge
 * [ ] Add linter CI script
 * [ ] Add Markdown spellcheck
 * [ ] Add broken links checker
 * [ ] Measure codecov
 * [ ] Do PR to demonstrate a bug

Other activities:

 * Rotate pairs
 * Big project: shared repo with simple tests

> Evaluation: Code on multiple GitHub tested thoroughly by GHA, developed by groups

## Thursday part 1: algorithms

> Goal: students have created multiple different types of algorithms

 * [ ] What is a good algorithm
 * [ ] Dimensions of a algorithm: speed, memory, disc, network
 * [ ] Type of algorithms overview
 * [ ] Iterative versus recursive
 * [ ] Exact or approximate
 * [ ] Deterministic or non-deterministic
 * [ ] Digital or quantum
 * [ ] Single-thread, multi-thread, distributed
 * [ ] Divide and conquer: qsort
 * [ ] Measuring speed to make rooftop plot
 * [ ] Caching results/LUTs
 * [ ] Do the bare minimum, e.g. `nth_element`
 * [ ] Using data structures to simplify algorithsm, e.g. use an ordered set to sort
 * [ ] Big O
 * [ ] Data structure: `dict`, for NW parameters

> Evaluation: Code on multiple GitHub tested thoroughly by GHA, developed by groups

## Thursday part 2: TDD

> Goal: students have develop tested code together

 * Recursive tests
 * BeyoncÃ© principle
 * YAGNI
 * DRY

> Evaluation: Code on multiple GitHub tested by GHA, 100% codecov, developed by groups

## Friday part 1: Modular programming

## Friday part 2: Optimization

> Goal: students have attempted to optimize code together

 * [ ] Problem: code is slow. How to make it fast?
 * [ ] Use [code from here](https://johnlekberg.com/blog/2020-10-25-seq-align.html)
 * [ ] Profiling
 * [ ] Need to have small functions
 * [ ] Only useful in release mode on big problems!
 * [ ] Bottlenecks: CPU versus file IO versus web IO
 * [ ] Techniques: sorting, storing
 * [ ] Other language: only if able
 * [ ] Multiple threads: not yet
 * [ ] Myths: experienced devs know where the bottleneck is
 * [ ] Myths: for loops are always evil, always use assembly/C/C++/Rust

> Evaluation: Code on one GitHub tested and profiled by GHA, developed by all
