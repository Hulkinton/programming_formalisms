# Day 4 part 1

 * 9:00-12:00
 * Richel
 * Goals: 
   * Theory: good algorithms
   * Students develop together in groups of 4
   * Form: group size: 4, use topic branches, use CI scripts, use code review

## 9:00-9:45 RB

 * Goals: 
   * Students can work in two pairs on one shared repo with `master`, `develop`, topic

When|What
----|-------------------------
9:00|Theory: algorithms: what is good? Why? Design by contract
9:15|Practice, focus on students that cannot get it to work
9:45|Break, have a break

## 10:00-10:45 RB

 * Goals: 
   * Students can do a PR
   * Students can give a code review

When |What
-----|-------------------------
10:00|Theory: role of `assert`, RNG, RNG seed and testing
10:15|Practice
10:45|Break, have a break

## 11:00-11:45 RB

 * Goals: 
   * Theory: Combining functions, `is_prime`, `is_prime_for_loop`, `is_prime_special`

When       |What
-----------|-------------------------
11:00      |Theory: combining algorithms
11:15      |Practice
11:45      |End, stay around for questions

## Observables

 * `owner_name/programming_formalisms_medium_project` (in groups of four)
