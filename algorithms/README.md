## Teaching goals

 * Students can write algorithms that are tested
 * Students can test that they use common data structures correctly

## Learning line

 * What is a good function
 * Type of algorithms
   * Iterative versus recursive
    * Write Fibonacci/sort in both ways
   * Exact or approximate
   * Deterministic or non-deterministic
   * Digital or quantum   
   * Single-thread, multi-thread, distributed
 * Divide and conquer: qsort
 * Measuring speed to make rooftop plot
 * Caching results/LUTs
 * Do the bare minimum, e.g. `nth_element`
 * Using data structures to simplify algorithsm
   * E.g. use an ordered set to sort


## Evaluation

 * Algorithms written by students that are tested on GitHub
