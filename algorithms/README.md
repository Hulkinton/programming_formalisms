# Algorithms

Problem:

 * How to write a good function?

A good function:

 * Has a clear name
 * Does one thing correctly
 * Is tested
 * Is documented
 * Fast iff needed

References:

 * [C++ Core Guidelines on functions](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-functions)
 * [R Tidyverse style guidelines on functions](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html)
 * [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python on general concepts](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/#general-concepts) 
 * ([PEP 20: The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/))

Theory:

 * Types of algorithms
 * Common data structures
 * Big O complexity
 * Parallelisms

Teaching goals:

 * Students can write algorithms that are tested
 * Students can test that they use common data structures correctly

Evaluation:

 * Algorithms written by students that are tested on GitHub
