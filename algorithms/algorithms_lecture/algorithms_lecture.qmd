## Problem

How to write a good function?

## What is a good function?

A good function:

 * Has a clear name
 * Does one thing correctly
 * Is tested
 * Is documented
 * Fast iff needed

 * [C++ Core Guidelines on functions](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-functions)
 * [R Tidyverse style guidelines on functions](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html)

## Definition of a good function in this course

A non-technical person can agree/disagree that the tests are valid

## Overview

 * Types of algorithms
 * Common data structures
 * Big O complexity
 * Parallelisms


## Code

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{python}
#| echo: true
print("Hello from Python")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
print("Hello from R")
```
