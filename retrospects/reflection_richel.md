# Reflection Richel

Start working on the bigger project earlier.
Explain the file structure on day

Use **one** project (I felt it was better to split up, but it would be better
if the students don't move between GitHub repos all the time).

When pair programming, always use 30 mins as a minimum:
15 minutes is too short to get a commit in.

Make `ruff` friendlier: just use the default settings;
the students felt it held them back, and in this context
I agree: whitespace errors are not worth it.

Use the bigger project earlier and more often:
add a CI script for big-O and profiling,
that runs from the start, 
so the students are comfortable using it for the part 
on optimizing.
