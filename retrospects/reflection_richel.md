# Reflection Richel, 2023-06-02

My part of the course turned out to be below the level of the students.
I am happy I noticed this quickly, from an exercise done at my first
course session. I am happy I adapted to this immediately and I knew
it would result in less well-prepared lectures, as I would not
have the time to go deeper than expected. 

I should let the students start working on the bigger project earlier,
so they feel more comfortable working in a more formalized environment.
The first session can then be spent to explain the file structure of that project.

Next time, I should use **one** project:
initially, I felt it was better to split up, but it would be better
if the students don't move between GitHub repos all the time.

When pair programming, always use 30 mins as a minimum:
15 minutes is too short to get a commit in.

Make `ruff` friendlier: just use the default settings;
the students felt it held them back, and in this context
I agree: whitespace errors are not worth it.

Use the bigger project earlier and more often:
add a CI script for big-O and profiling,
that runs from the start, 
so the students are comfortable using it for the part 
on optimizing.

I agree with the students that it is the academic paper
where the design starts.
I will volunteer to have a more streamlined course order with:

1. Academic paper, especially a pre-registered paper as an example
2. Design
3. TDD
4. Programming details
5. In the end, go back to the paper again
