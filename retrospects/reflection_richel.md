# Reflection Richel

When pair programming, always use 30 mins as a minimum:
15 minutes is too short to get a commit in.

Make `ruff` friendlier: just use the default settings;
the students felt it held them back, and in this context
I agree: whitespace errors are not worth it.

Use the bigger project earlier and more often:
add a CI script for big-O and profiling,
that runs from the start, 
so the students are comfortable using it for the part 
on optimizing.
