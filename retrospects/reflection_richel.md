# Reflection Richel, 2023-06-02

## Adaptation to students

My part of the course turned out to be below the level of the students.
I am happy I noticed this quickly, from an exercise done at my first
course session. I am happy I adapted to this immediately and I knew
it would result in less well-prepared lectures, as I would not
have the time to go deeper than expected. 

## One central (non-biology) theme

I feel the course could be streamlined by doing a full academic
research in a formal way: start with paper, then design, then code.
This was the original idea as well: to do a DNA alignment.
Due to us teachers adapting to the students (a good thing!),
the unity of the material was ruffled up a bit.

I will suggest to -as teachers- to work on a simple project together
from start to end. I feel it should not be a biological project, 
but something on a simple-to-understand dataset.

## Practicals

I should let the students start working on the bigger project earlier,
so they feel more comfortable working in a more formalized environment.
The first session can then be spent to explain the file structure of that project.

Next time, I should use **one** project:
initially, I felt it was better to split up, but it would be better
if the students don't move between GitHub repos all the time.

When pair programming, always use 30 mins as a minimum:
15 minutes is too short to get a commit in.

Make `ruff` friendlier: just use the default settings;
the students felt it held them back, and in this context
I agree: whitespace errors are not worth it.

Use the bigger project earlier and more often:
add a CI script for big-O and profiling,
that runs from the start, 
so the students are comfortable using it for the part 
on optimizing.

## Academics are the audience

I agree with the students that it is the academic paper
where the design starts.
I will volunteer to have a more streamlined course order with:

1. Academic paper, especially a pre-registered paper as an example
2. Design
3. TDD
4. Programming details
5. In the end, go back to the paper again

## Reflections

I am happy we did Reflections, as these help us change the direction
of the course. OTOH, due to this I asked for less feedback and I missed
discussing this openly with students.

I do feel the students have been too mild on me.
Especially the last day, I wanted to hear that I was not as concise
as before (as I wasn't). Due to this, I would enjoy a more ruthless and
anonymous evaluation at the last day.
